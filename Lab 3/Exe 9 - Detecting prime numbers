// Exercise 9: Detecting prime numbers (10 points)

// Write a console program that asks the user to enter an integer greater than 1. 
// The program determines if the number entered is prime and writes a message to standard output stream stating whether the number is prime or not. 
// For example, if the user enters 42, the program displays "42 is not prime." 
// If the user enters 47, the program displays "47 is prime."

// Be sure to test your program's output with 8 different numbers. 
// It is important to test your program's output after compiling it to make sure that your code is correct. 
// Document these test cases at the bottom of your code, showing the input and output of each. 
// Example:

// n      result
// 1      prime
// 2      not prime
// 3      prime

// and so on

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  cout << "Please enter an integer greater than 1: ";
  int n;
  cin >> n;
  if (n <= 1) {
    cout << "Please enter an integer greater than 1: ";
  }
  for (int i = 2; i <= (n - 2); i++) {
    if ((n%i) == 0) {
      cout << n << " is not prime.";
    }
    else {
      cout << n << " is prime.";
