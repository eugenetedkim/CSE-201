// Exercise 8: Random integers (10 points)

// Write a program that generates a list of 100 random integers in [0, 100), which means between 0 and 99 inclusive.

// Save the program output by redirecting the standard output stream to a file.
// To do this, run the program as follows.

// ./a.out > numbers.txt

// Open numbers.txt in a text editor to see the result.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>

using namespace std;

int randomBetween(int s, int e) {
  int range = e - s;
  int n = s + rand() % range;
  return n;
}

int main(int argc, char * args[]) {
  srand(time(0));
  int n = randomBetween(10, 20);
  cout << "Random number between 10 and 20: " << n << endl;
}
