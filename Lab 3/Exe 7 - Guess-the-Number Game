// Exercise 7: Guess-the-Number Game (10 points)

// Write a program that implements Guess-the-Number game.
// The program should enter a loop that starts by printing "What year did Pakistan achieve independence?"
// After printing this, it reads the user response.
// (Use cin >> n to read the user response.)
// If the user enters a value less than 1947, the program prints "too early" and continues the loop.
// If the user enters a number larger than 1947, the program prints "too late" and continues the loop.
// If the user enters the number 1947, the program prints "you got it" and then terminates.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
  int n;
  bool flag = false;
  while (flag != true) {
    cout << "What year did Pakistan achieve independence?"<<endl;
    cin >> n;
    if (n < 1947) {
    cout << "too early" << endl;
    }
    else if (n > 1947) {
    cout << "too late" << endl;
	  }
    else {
			cout << "you got it" << endl;
			flag = true;
	  }
