// Lab 3

// Exercise 3: Random integers (10 points)

// Write a program that prints a random integer.

// The C++ standard library contains a pseudo random number generator that you can use to solve this problem. 
// The function rand returns a pseudo random number. 
// To use rand in your programs, you need to include the cstdlib header as follows.

//  #include <cstdlib>

//  srand(719);  // Seed the random number generator with 719.

// The following is an example of how you can use the return value of rand.

//  cout << rand();

// You can vary the seed passed into srand by calling the time function. 
// Calling the time function with 0 as an argument produces the number of seconds from a given epoch (January 1, 1970 by convention). 
// The following code shows how to seed rand with this time.

//  srand(time(0));

// To use the time function in your program, you need to include the ctime header as follows.

//  #include <ctime>

// You'll need to call srand with the time function in order to get a different random number each time you run the program.

#include <iostream>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <ctime>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	srand(time(0));
	cout << rand();
	return 0;
}
