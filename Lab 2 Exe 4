//Lab 2

//Exercise 4: if-else statement with the OR operator (10 points)

//Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a temperature.
//If the user enters a number between 70 and 85, then print "good weather" else print "bad weather".
//Use the or operator (||) to solve this problem.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Enter temperature: ";
	int temp;
	cin >> temp;
	if ( temp <= 69 || temp >= 86 ) {
		cout << "bad  weather" << endl;
	}
	else {
		cout << "good  weather" << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
