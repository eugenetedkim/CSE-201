// Experience Working with C++ (10 points)

// This section explains how to write, compile and run a simple C++ console program in your remote Cloud9 workspace. 
// The program is called a hello program because when it runs, it prints hello.

// Create a file named hello.cpp in your Cloud9 workspace and fill it with the following contents.

// #include <iostream>

// using namespace std;

// int main(int argc, char * args[]) {
//   cout << "hello\n";
//   return 0;
// }

// From a Cloud9 terminal window, run the following command to compile hello.cpp.

// c++ hello.cpp

// The above command generates an executable file named a.out.
// To run this file, issue the following from the command line.

// ./a.out
// Modify the source code in hello.cpp so that it displays a greeting to you, such as Hello, David. 
// Test that your changes produce an executable file that runs as expected.
