// Background

// When keyboards and monitors were first used in the early days of computers,
// all interaction with the computer was done by typing in characters and reading text displayed on the screen.
// There were no mice and no graphics other than characters were displayed in the screen.
// You can still interact with computers in this way; it is done using a program called a console or a terminal window.
// It turns out that this old style interface is very useful and frequently used to this day by programmers and system administrators.
// This is especially true for Linux systems, which are the predominate operating system for distributed computing resources on the Internet.
// For this reason, in this course we will learn how to use the command line interface.


// Preparation (10 points)

// You will do your assignments using a Cloud9 workspace.
// Your instructor will use your email to send you an invitation to join the csusb team on Cloud9.
// The email will have the word support in the subject line. When you receive this email, follow the link to create a free Cloud9 account.
// Then do the following.

// Create a new workspace outside of the csusb team with these options:
// Select the team to "Don't set a team for this workspace."
// Workspace name: cse201 (other name is OK)
// Template: Blank
// Access: Private
// Open the new workspace you created.
// Click Share in the top right corner.
// Under the Invite People box, invite csusbdt with RW access. Ask your TA for their Cloud 9 id and invite them.


// Learn the Command Line Interface (20 points)

// For this assignment, you should complete the interactive Codecademy command line tutorial.
// You will need to create a free account with Codecademy for this purpose.
// The tutorial covers topics that will not appear on quizzes or exams;
// see the description above and the list of example quiz questions to understand what type of problems
// you are expected to solve from memory in this course.

// command completion

// One helpful feature of the terminal window is called command completion.
// If you press tab in the command line, the system will try to complete what you are typing by looking for a matching filename.

// command history

// Another helpful feature is called command history.
// This feature allows you to access a record of commands that you previously entered.
// Use the up and down arrow keys to scroll through the command history.
// Press enter at any previously entered command to run it again.


// Experience Working with C++ (10 points)

// This section explains how to write, compile and run a simple C++ console program in your remote Cloud9 workspace.
// The program is called a hello program because when it runs, it prints hello.

// Create a file named hello.cpp in your Cloud9 workspace and fill it with the following contents.

// #include <iostream>

// using namespace std;

// int main(int argc, char * args[]) {
       cout << "hello\n";
       return 0;
// }

// From a Cloud9 terminal window, run the following command to compile hello.cpp.

// c++ hello.cpp

// The above command generates an executable file named a.out. To run this file, issue the following from the command line.

// ./a.out

// Modify the source code in hello.cpp so that it displays a greeting to you, such as Hello, David.

// Test that your changes produce an executable file that runs as expected.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main(int argc, char * args[]) {
    cout << "Hello, Eugene\n";
    return 0;
}
