// Exercise 3: Strings (10 points)

// A person's initials is the first letter of their first name, 
// followed by a period, followed by the first letter of their last name, 
// followed by a period.
// For example, the initials for David Turner are D.T.

// Write a program that prompts the user for a first name and then prompt the user for a last name. 
// Have the program display the user's initials.

// As part of your solution, define a function named initials, which takes 2 arguments: 
// the first name and the last name. The function returns the person's initials as a string.

// Because the function arguments don't need to be changed and are complex data types, 
// you should pass them into the function as const references.

// Hint: use the substr function or the index operator of the string data type.

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

string initials(const string firstName, const string lastName) {
    string first = firstName.substr(0,1);
    string last = lastName.substr(0,1);
    string firstLast = first + "." + last + ".";
    return firstLast;
}

int main() {
    string firstLast;
    cout << "What is your first name? " << endl;
    string firstName;
