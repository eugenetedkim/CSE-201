/*
Exercise 7: Pass by reference (10 points)
Implement a function that increases the value of an integer passed into it by 1.
The function has the following signature.
void addOne(int & k);
Write test code with assertions to verify that you implemented the function correctly.
Unlike the previous exercise, you can not call the addOne function with a constant because the function's argument is a reference.
*/

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

void addOne(int & k) {
    k = k + 1;
}

int main() {
    cout << "Please enter an integer: ";
    int k;
    cin >> k;
    addOne(k);
    cout << "One greater than your integer is: " << k << endl;
}
