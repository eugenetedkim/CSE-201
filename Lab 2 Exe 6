// Lab 2

// Exercise 6: The else-if statement (10 points)

// Write a C++ program that prompts the user for a temperature value.
// The program should print "cool" when the temperature is greater than 40 and less than or equal to 60, 
// should print "warm" when the temperature is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 85 
// and should print "don't go outside" for all other temperature values.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main() {
	cout << "Enter temperature: ";
	int temp;
	cin >> temp;
	if (temp > 40  && temp <= 60) {
		cout << "cool" << endl;
	}
	else if (temp > 60 && temp <= 85) {
		cout << "warm" << endl;
	}
	 else {
		cout << "don't go outside" << endl;
	}
	return 0;
